# Numeris — Strategy & Intuition

This repository contains the Numeris SPA built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Quick start (local):

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd harmonious-path-design
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # optional local preview
```

Deploy on Vercel:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new project on Vercel and link the GitHub repo.
3. Vercel will detect the Vite app and deploy. The included `vercel.json` ensures SPA routing rewrites to `index.html`.

If you need help with custom domains or advanced configuration, ask and I can add those steps.
